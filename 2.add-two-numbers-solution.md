# Complexity
Time: O( l1 + l2)
Space: O(1)
# Solution
In this problem, we need to accept two Linked Lists, which are not guaranteed to be the same length. The  # of nodes falls into the range [1, 100] so we don't have to worry too much about the amount nodes. The two linked lists hold a full number, that is inserted into the list in reverse order.

What does reverserd order mean?
It means the actual number is read, from right to left in this Linked List. Another way of saying this is that, the head node contains the digit which will in the ones place, or 10^0 place in the digit.

I will use this point to solve the problem my own way.

## Algorithm
1. Make temporary head pointers to the list (don't want to lose the head pointer)
2.  iterate through both lists and find the size for both lists.
3.  reset the temporary pointers to the heads of both lists respectively. Also create variables that will hold the complete number that both lists represent, lastly create an exponent variable for each list.
4. Iterate both lists, until both of have been iterated. 
	1. Check if the sie of list 1 is not 0
	2. Grab the value for that node,  and multiply it with  10^(exponent1) finally add it to the sum variable for  list 1.
	3. Do the same for list 2
5. Now that we have the whole number for both lists, add them together to get the sum that we need to return for the answer.
6. Create a new head node for our return list.
7. The data in this head node will hold the totalSum % 10 using "% 10" allows us to extract the right most digit of the totalSum.
8. Create a temporary head for our new list.
9. While TotalSum is not 0, we will  create a Node and link, it to the previous Node. This new node will contain the value totalSum % 10
10. update totalSum with the value totalSum / 10
11. Move to the newly create Node, and repeat until TotalSum  / 10 is 0, as this signifies we have no more numbers to process.
