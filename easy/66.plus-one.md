# Algorithm
Let's calculate the number, in terms of an int data type, then add 1 to it, to let the computer do the work of handiling the carry value. Then to save space, we will use the original digits value, and replace or insert at the front as needed.

1. Grab length - 1 of digits, this will be the exponent value for base 10.
2. iterate through digits and multiply each digit  by 10 ^ (exponent) and add it to the sum
3. We've constructed our int, now lets increment it by 1 and create a newExp variable that will increment up 
4. Now while our int is not 0 loop
	1. If newExp is greater than the length of digits then we know that our number grew. So we insert newNumber % 10 at the front. (At this point we should be ahead of the front of the original number)
	2. Else, we approach from the right most digit in digits, and use newExp to offset to the index being operated on. At this index we insert newNumber % 10
	3. increment newExp and divide newNumber by 10
5. return digits
