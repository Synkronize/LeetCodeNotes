# Algorithm
In this case, while my code is messy the algorithm is simple.
1. Get the last index for both lists and initialize the carry to  0
2. figure out which list if longer and make it the main list 
3. prepare our return string in our loop we will build this string using +.
4. while our smaller list still has values to iterate
	1. grab bit1 and bit2 from respective lists
	2. if there is a carry handle the carry case
	3. handle the addition case of the 1/0, 0/1 combination
	3(alt). handle the 1/1 case and set carry to 1
	3(alt2). handle 0/0 case.
	4. decrement index of smaller list and index of bigger list.
5. while we still have one list left do:
	1. check if carry bit is 1, if so handle the carry bit, if the current bit is 0 then carry will be set to 0 after, if not carry will stay 1.
	1(alt). add current bit to our rtnString
	2. decrement the mainListIndex to check the next bit.
6. if we dont have a carry, return the rtnString
7. if we do have a carry, return '1' + rtnString
